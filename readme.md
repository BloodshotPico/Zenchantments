# Zenchantments
## Description
Zenchantments is a custom enchantment plugin adds 70+ new enchantments to the game, covering a multitude of different uses. These include target-tracing arrows, lumber axes, block-breaking lasers, and much more. These custom enchantments are obtained through the normal enchantment process, and act like regular enchantments, capable of being combined and merged. The plugin also adds several new arrows, which can be crafted through special recipes. These can do things like encase a target in spiderwebs, strike lightning onto the ground, and launch grenades.

## Download
See [Releases] (https://github.com/Zedly/Zenchantments/Releases) for downloads

## Compile
To compile the project yourself, you need the latest version of CraftBukkit as a Maven repository. This is created automatically when you use [BuildTools] (https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/) to obtain CB and/or Spigot.

## Compatibility
The current version of this plugin requires a CraftBukkit/Spigot server providing NMS v1.11_R1. Multi-version support will happen soon, as the dependency is very light and does not use obfuscated methods (meaning an update is often as easy as fixing the dependency package name)
